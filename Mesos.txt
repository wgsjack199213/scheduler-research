Mesos: A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center
NSDI 2011

是什么？
a platform for sharing commodity clusters between multiple diverse cluster computing frameworks, such as Hadoop and MPI.

和YARN的对比

谁是调度器？
Mesos master node(centralized global schedule)

调度部分？
frameworks register their own scheduler into Mesos
two level: 1 mesos master delivers idle resource to a certain framework (所以粒度很粗); 2 the framework’s own scheduler
Mesos decides how many resources to offer each framework, while frameworks decide which resources to accept and which computations to run on them

资源分配策略？
pluggable
so far, two modules are implemented: 1 fair sharing based on a generalization of max-min fairness for multiple resources (Dominant resource fairness: fair allocation of multiple resource types), 2 strict priorities
